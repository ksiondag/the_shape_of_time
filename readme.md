# The Shape of Time

Game for [Ludum Dare 35](https://twitter.com/ludumdare/status/721141090993049600).

The theme is Shapeshift.

Use version control concepts to warp to or merge with parallel realities. Shift
time to achieve a reality where the given problem is already solved.

Explore the fourth dimension.

## Installing

Do you have nodejs version 4.x.x or greater? Great, you should be able to play
this game....

On Linux.

I have no idea if this will play on Windows or Mac.

I should probably see.

## How to Play

Run index.js with nodejs from the_shape_of_time directory

## Post-Mortem

Didn't have the time nor focus to get very far with the game. I basically
remade the "engine" of a previous game jam game, and quickly remade that game's
first two levels.

I like the result, and how easy it is to make levels now, but overall it's not
nearly as interesting or as complete as the previous game. Also, because I
didn't use node's builtin "path" module for creating paths, I'm pretty sure
this game wouldn't run on Windows.

I hope this begins a tradition of making a game per weekend. I mean, I'm fine
remaking the same game per weekend, but I need to start "from scratch". Though,
peeking at previous content and/or building a library or engine week-to-week
is perfectly fine.

Let's see what I manage next weekend!
